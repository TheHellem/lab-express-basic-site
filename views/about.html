            <p>Henrik Johan Ibsen (20 March 1828â€“23 May 1906) was a Norwegian playwright and theatre director. 
                As one of the founders of modernism in theatre, Ibsen is often referred to as "the father of realism" 
                and one of the most influential playwrights of his time. His major works include Brand, Peer Gynt, 
                An Enemy of the People, Emperor and Galilean, A Doll's House, Hedda Gabler, Ghosts, The Wild Duck, 
                When We Dead Awaken, Rosmersholm, and The Master Builder. Ibsen is the most frequently performed dramatist 
                in the world after Shakespeare, and A Doll's House was the world's most performed play in 2006</p>
